- New APIs needed (e.g., `GET /api/articles`, `POST /api/articles`)
- Data model (fields, sample payloads)

## 3. Behavior
- SSR or CSR? (If SSR, which data required at render time?)
- Auth/roles required? (e.g., admin, super_admin)
- Empty state behavior (what to show when no data)

## 4. UI/UX

- Components impacted or new components
- Edge cases (loading, errors, pagination)

## 5. Integration
- External services (Firebase/others) and required env vars
- Analytics/tracking if any

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
- Bullet list of testable outcomes (e.g., "When no data, show 'No items' card")
