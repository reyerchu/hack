@dev Returns the root of a tree reconstructed from `leaves` and sibling nodes in `proof`. The reconstruction\n proceeds by incrementally reconstructing all inner nodes by combining a leaf/inner node with either another\n leaf/inner node or a proof sibling node, depending on whether each `proofFlags` item is true or false\n respectively.\n This version handles multiproofs in calldata with the default hashing function.\n CAUTION: Not all Merkle trees admit multiproofs. To use multiproofs, it is sufficient to ensure that: 1) the tree\n is complete (but not necessarily perfect), 2) the leaves to be proven are in the opposite order they are in the\n tree (i.e., as seen from right to left starting at the deepest layer and continuing at the next layer).\n NOTE: The _empty set_ (i.e. the case where `proof.length == 1 && leaves.length == 0`) is considered a no-op,\n and therefore a valid multiproof (i.e. it returns `proof[0]`). Consider disallowing this case if you're not\n validating the leaves
